# easy_dst

I want to solve a couple problems with this library: 1. Make custom dynamically sized types (hereafter DSTs) *much* more ergonomic to define and instantiate. 2. Make such DSTs available on the stack (or heap, but doing *that* isn't currently *too* difficult without help of a library). 3. Make such DSTs available in const context. 4. Custom DSTs must be of arbitrary size, and shouldn't require the user to know their size when they create them. I've seen some other crates that try to solve problems 1-3, but they 5. (Long term, potentially out-of-scope?) Make it so you can create nested custom DSTs.
